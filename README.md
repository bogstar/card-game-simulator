# card-game-simulator

A Unity3D project where there has been an attempt at creating an original Card Building game - a mashup of Hearthstone, Darkest Dungeon, Slay the Spire. Project is still ongoing and is currently being developed by me and my colleague, and while being only a hobby, perhaps some day might be even used for commercial purposes. The current head is not present on this repository, rather on a private fork. The details are kept secret, as to protect intelectual property.

Only the C# scripts are present in this cloned repository. They are being revised presently.
